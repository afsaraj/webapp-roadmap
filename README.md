# 🌐 Full-Stack Web App Development Roadmap (ASP.NET Core + React) – By Afsar Ahamed

## 🎯 Goal
Master modern web application development using **ASP.NET Core (C#)** for backend and **React** for frontend — including APIs, authentication, deployment, real-time communication, and full-stack project delivery.

This roadmap is designed for developers who want to become **job-ready full-stack engineers** using enterprise-grade .NET technologies and a modern JavaScript frontend.

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Web Development Foundations

### 🧠 Core Concepts
- HTTP, RESTful APIs, client-server model
- Frontend vs Backend responsibilities
- JSON, AJAX, CORS
- Web app vs SPA vs SSR vs PWA

### 🔧 Tools
- Visual Studio / VS Code
- Postman / Insomnia
- Git, GitHub

📦 **Project**: Simple HTML form + local JSON API + fetch call

---

## 📍 Phase 2: ASP.NET Core Fundamentals (Backend)

### 🧠 Topics
- MVC vs Web API
- Routing, Controllers, Services
- Dependency Injection in .NET
- Entity Framework Core (EF Core) + LINQ
- SQLite / PostgreSQL / SQL Server integration
- Environment configs, secrets management

### 📦 Projects
- Task manager API (CRUD)
- Simple blog engine with REST endpoints

---

## 📍 Phase 3: React Fundamentals (Frontend)

### 🧠 Topics
- React components, hooks, props, state
- React Router DOM (navigation, dynamic routes)
- Controlled vs uncontrolled inputs
- Axios / fetch for API calls
- Form validation with Yup + Formik
- Reusable components & layout structure

### 📦 Projects
- Task manager frontend for the ASP.NET API
- Blog listing page + post view

---

## 📍 Phase 4: Full-Stack Integration

### 🔧 Skills
- API Integration (CORS, error handling)
- Global state (Redux or Context API)
- Toasts, loading indicators, error fallback
- Pagination, search, filtering

### 📦 Project
- Full-featured blog app with .NET backend + React frontend
  - Auth, post CRUD, user roles
  - Light/dark mode UI toggle
  - Comments section (nested)

---

## 📍 Phase 5: Authentication & Authorization

### 🛡️ Topics
- ASP.NET Identity vs custom auth
- JWT-based authentication
- Login/signup + protected routes
- Role-based access control (admin/user)

### 📦 Project Add-ons
- User registration + login/logout
- Token refresh, password reset
- Admin dashboard with access gates

---

## 📍 Phase 6: Real-Time Features + File Uploads

### 📡 Topics
- SignalR for real-time updates (chat, notifications)
- File upload (images, PDFs)
- Drag & drop upload UI in React
- Store files in filesystem / S3 / Azure Blob

### 📦 Project Add-ons
- Real-time chat in blog comments
- Upload post images with previews

---

## 📍 Phase 7: Testing, CI/CD & Deployment

### 🧪 Testing
- xUnit for .NET
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Postman test scripts / Swagger

### 🚀 CI/CD & Deployment
- Dockerize backend + frontend
- GitHub Actions for build/test workflows
- Deployment: Render, Railway, Azure App Service, or AWS
- Static hosting (Vercel, Netlify) for React

📦 **Deliverables**:
- Docker Compose full-stack deployment
- Live demo links + README + CI badge
